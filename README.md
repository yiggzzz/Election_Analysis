# Election Analysis Challenge

 ## Project Overview
 This project helped the user utilize Python to: 
 - Create scripts that read, write, and store data from files or in arrays,
 - Perform mathematical operations
 - Use decision statements, repetition statements, logical operators and complex comparisons,
 -  Produce screen outputs
 
 # Challenge Objectives
First objective: A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given the user the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.
 
 1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
 2. Gather a complete list of candidates who received votes.
 3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
 4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
 5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
 
 Second objective: The Election Commission has asked for further analsysis into the election data.

 1. Calculate the voter turnout for each county that voted in the congressional district.
 2. Calculate the percentage of votes each county contributed to the election.
 2. Determine which county had the largest turnout.
